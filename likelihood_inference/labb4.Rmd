#Problem 8d)

Since $X+1 = Z$ where $Z$ is geometrically distributed with parameter $\pi$ this means that we can generate a sample from $X$ by first generating geometrically distributed random variables and then removing 1.

```{r}
T <- function(X){
  sum(X)
}

likelihood <- function(t,X){
  prod(dgeom(X,t))
}

x1 <- rgeom(200,0.4)
x2 = sample(x1,length(x1),replace=FALSE)

xseq <- seq(0+0.01,1-0.01,length=100)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(xseq,sapply(xseq,function(t) likelihood(t,x1)),type="l",col="blue")
plot(xseq,sapply(xseq,function(t) likelihood(t,x2)),type="l",col="red")

```

$T$ is a sufficient statistic for $\pi$ and since we are sampling form $x_1$ without replacement we will get the same sample but in a different order. This means that $T(x1) = T(x2)$ so the sufficiency principle says that we should draw the same conclusions regarding $\pi$ from sample $x_1$ and sample $x_2$. We see that the likelihood functions for $x_1$ and $x_2$ are exactly the same which makes it reasonable to draw the same conclusions about $\pi$.
